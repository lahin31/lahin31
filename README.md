# üë®‚Äçüíª Muhammad Lahin

I am a **Software Engineer** with over **7 years of experience** in building scalable, secure, and efficient software systems.  
Passionate about **Requirement Analysis**, **Server-side Architecture**, **Database Design**, and **UI Architecture**, I started my career as a **JavaScript Developer** and have since expanded my expertise across the full software development lifecycle.

My work spans creating **sophisticated user interfaces**, **designing efficient database schemas** for SQL/NoSQL systems, **optimizing production performance**, **developing REST APIs**, **implementing Continuous Deployment pipelines**, and **leading engineering teams**.

I am deeply interested in how systems work, which led me to author [System Design Bangla](https://github.com/lahin31/system-design-bangla).

‚ú® *Always open to discussions on Software Development, System Design, and related topics.*
